8/24 COMMIT CHANGES:
. all functional polyphonic components are accessible from unified header PolyUtils.hpp. if you want to include PolyUtils in your project, use this!
. fleshed out PolySample arithmetic operators, added mask logical ops, mac, sqrt, abs, etc
. added stats tools to PolySampleBuffer: avg, rms, stddev, etc
. added PolyVolume device to keep track of different volume metrics, will be used for pre-voice closed loop gain control and compression
. PolySignalUtility now has limited functionality. It can output polyphonic CV and morph it with a knob, this is meant for controlling per-voice parameters

quick todos:
single pole/PolyFilterCascade (optional)
filter nonlinearities (optional)

folder disperse
folder delay

rect unit

octop mix knob

ORGANIZED TODOS:
. overload boolean PolySample mask operators (if unavailable)
. update ScrollableDisplay, current ScrollerData is too bulky
. move submodule UI controls into submodule objects
. connect all controls and datapaths
. DATAPATH DONE! but then...
. add PolyResampler/high quality derivatives - PARTIAL
. manually add asin and acos PolySample definitions
. optionally add log, exp, sqrt to ops
. add dispersion and trigger delay settings to wavefolders - PARTIAL
. add differentiator sensing to end of wavefolders and mix filtering in if derivs are too high... maybe
. waveshape/replace???
. add rectifier forward integration capability
. add PolyFilterCascade and pole count adjustment - PARTIAL
. maybe add peak and shelving filters, marginal chance for phaser and comb filters
. write new ScrollableDisplay knobs. this includes horizontal scrolling for pole adjustment
. possibly collect all poly stuff into a PolyUtils file
. add nonlinearities to PolyFilter feedback path?
. accessibility port (likely to get cut)
. mix knob
. write detailed manual
. get feedback (optional)
. professionalize UI
. release fully

PRIMARY ROADMAP:
. redesign wavefolder
    . widen folder UI (and module by extension)
    . add 2 separate gain controls
    . maybe cut disperse setting
    . 2 way filter setting
    . filter location setting

. write/rewrite custom controls
    . add support for the horiz + vert scrolling that the filter setting requires
. write rect controller
. update filters
. misc stuff
    . add gain knob to main and side signals on input UI


POLYSAMPLE TODOS:
. add easy MAC operations - DONE
. add lhs float operations - DONE
. add x= operations - DONE
. implement digital logic operations - DONE
. add isn and ics operations
. add collapse/voice sorting operation - DONE
. add toString and fromString properly
. add increment and decrement operators - DONE
. add comparison operations - DONE

POLYFILTER TODOS:
. adjust updatecoefs - DONE
. package every update function into updatecoefs_alltypes - DONE
. finish adding shelving filters
. add nonlinearity setting - DONE

WAVEFOLDER TODOS:
. move filters to fold unit
. try implementing disperse setting


PROPOSAL: PolySignalUtility
Utility for generating polyphonic control signals. 
can generate ascending, descending, nonlinear polyphonic patterns.
can be restricted to a certain number of channels.

PROPOSAL: Release folder and filter as standalone modules
